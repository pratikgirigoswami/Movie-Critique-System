# Movie-Critique-System
People have been widely using online platforms such as blogs, websites, discussion forums, and other types of social media to provide feedback on various products and services. In this project, we designed a system that can summarize movie reviews and provide a summarized critique to help the user make the decision easily without going through plenty of reviews from different people. We have proposed a method that uses supervised learning for the binary classification of movie reviews. 
• The proposed method extracts reviews from Twitter and analyzes them to finalize the overall review as either positive or negative along with summarized critique.
• Major Steps:
 o Twitter Data Acquisition
 o Data Cleaning
 o Summarizing using BERT
 o Classification
 o Modelling of IMDB dataset (compared three models – GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB)
 o Deployment on Telegram Chatbot
 • Software/Tools/Programming Language Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Tweepy, Textblob, Vader, Flair, Twint, Telegram
